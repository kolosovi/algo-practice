I have an array `window` that holds nums sorted DESC. I have its start so I can remove the biggest element in O(1) time and I also can remove smaller elements quickly (i.e. remove M smallest elements).

no, this is bullshit

for i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++:
    if window size >= k:  # this means that we must remove the OLDEST element
        increment window start - but this doesn't work. It works if window has k elements.
        pop off window while elements are smaller than us
        push the new element
    else:  # this means that we don't have to remove the oldest element
        pop off window while elements are smaller than us
        push the new element

MAYBE: really a deque, AND we store INDEXES rather than nums. So an index gives us the "depth" of the number and its value.

We see if the first element is "too deep". If so we just remove it. We then remove irrelevant numbers from end and store ours. And we repeat this.
