You are given a blank screen and a stream of operations:
- Add (x, y): adds a point with coordinates (x, y) to the screen and returns
    the bounding box of points after the operation. A point can be added
    multiple times, this creates duplicate instances of a single point.
- Remove (x, y): removes a point with coordinates (x, y) from the screen and
    returns the bounding box of points after the operation. If there are several
    points at this location, only one instance is removed. It is guaranteed that
    Remove won't be called for a location that contains no points.

Your task is to implement Add & Remove with reasonable efficiency, e.g. N^2
where N is the total number of operations is NOT reasonable.

Coordinates x and y are integers.

Bounding box is a rectangle with its sides parallel to ordinate x and y axes.
It includes the bounded points, e.g. a bounding box of a single point is a
rectangle with all corners equal to that point.

Bounding box is defined by the coordinates of its upper left and bottom right
corners.
