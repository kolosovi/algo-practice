Implement a simple version of [std::shared_ptr](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr).

- On copy or copy assignment it must destroy its pointee if this shared_ptr is the last one pointing at it
- On move or move assignment: the same
- On destructing it must destroy its pointee if this shared_ptr is the last one pointing at it
- operator bool returns false if empty, true otherwise
- `get` returns pointee
- `use_count` returns # of shared_ptr objects that own the pointee
- OK if not thread-safe
